1. Boot the Linux main image (L) 
2. Open Up the terminal
3. Change Directories to where the jar file has been downloaded or stored through the terminal
	e.g>> cd Downloads (If it is in your downloads directory)
4. Once in the correct directory, run the jar file by typing the following into the terminal:

	>> java -jar VIDIVOX_izhu678.jar
	
5. A prompt should appear for you to choose a video.

	You may ignore the warning signs generated in the terminal output when VIDIVOX is running.



Note about adding MP3 audio:
**Caution** 
 - It is not recommended to overlay audio to a video file that has already been merged by VIDIVOX.
 - If you would like to add ANOTHER mp3 over the current video again, REOPEN the same video file again and THEN add addtional an audio file over the video.
